                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Roadmap.sh is the place containing community curated roadmaps, study plans, paths and resources for the budding developers. It started as a set of charts to guide the developers who are confused about what should they learn next but that alone wasn't enough so I expanded it into the website to get more contributors involved.</p>

            <div class="accordion-item">
                <button class="accordion-header">What are the plans for roadmap.sh?</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The website started off as a simple repository containing a few charts for developers and based on my personal opinions but it could have been much more than that so I decided to expand it to a website where people can contribute to study plans with their areas of expertise as well, add more roadmaps, write guides etc.

                        We haven't opened up the sign ups for now but we will be doing. My long term plans for this website are to turn it into a goto place for the developers to seek guidance about their careers, help others, share their journeys, incentivize the learnings, get feedbacks on their projects etc.</p>

                <button class="accordion-header">How is roadmap.sh build?</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The basic version of the website has been built with Next.js, is opensource and can be found on github. It was hastily done to get it out in front of the people and get people to start contributing so it might be rough on the edges, but that is where we need your help.</p>

            <div class="accordion-item">
                <button class="accordion-header">How does it make money?</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>It doesn't make any money. I have been using my personal time and budget to build it. I did not create this website with any intentions of monetization but as a good will, to help the people get out of the frustration that I was once in.

                        Having said that, I love teaching and my future plans are to be able to work full-time on roadmap.sh for which it has to make enough money to pay for my rent, groceries, bills, travel expenses, etc but even if it doesn't it's likely I'll continue growing the site however I can. My focus at the moment is not making money from it and just add content that creates value for the people.</p>
